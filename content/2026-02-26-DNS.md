# Domain Name System

```text
1. Core Purpose & Function : What DNS is and the problem its solves
2. The DNS Hierarchy : The different types of DNS servers(Recursive,Root, TLD,Authoritative)
3. The Resolution Journey : Step-by-step flow of DNS query
4. DNS Record Types: Deep dive into A, AAAA, CNAME, ALIAS, MX, and TXT records.
5. Caching & TTL: How performance is optimized and the trade-offs involved.
6. Advanced/Systems Design Concepts: DNS routing (Anycast, Round Robin) and Security (DNSSEC).
```

1. DNS is internet directory. 
2. It translates human-readable domain name into IP address (such as google.com to machine readable IP address like 93.184.296.34 example)

    participant  browser 
    participant  DNS Resolver
    
    browser ->> DNS Resolver : www.google.com
    DNS Resolver ->> browser : 93.184.216.34
    
```
3. How does DNS Work?
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant OS as Operating System
    participant Res as ISP DNS Resolver
    participant Root as Root Nameserver (.)
    participant TLD as TLD Nameserver (.com)
    participant Auth as Auth Nameserver (google.com)

    U->>B: Types www.google.com

    rect rgb(240, 248, 255)
        Note over B, OS: 1. Local Caching Phase
        B->>B: Check Browser Cache
        B->>OS: Cache Miss? Ask OS (gethostbyname)
        OS->>OS: Check OS Cache (hosts file / DNS client)
    end

    rect rgb(245, 245, 245)
        Note over OS, Res: 2. Recursive Query Phase
        OS->>Res: Cache Miss? Send DNS Query to ISP
        Res->>Res: Check Resolver Cache
    end

    rect rgb(255, 240, 245)
        Note over Res, Auth: 3. Iterative Query Phase
        Res->>Root: Where is www.google.com?
        Root-->>Res: Ask the .com TLD server (IP provided)

        Res->>TLD: Where is www.google.com?
        TLD-->>Res: Ask Google's Auth server (IP provided)

        Res->>Auth: What is the IP for www.google.com?
        Auth-->>Res: The IP is 142.250.190.4
    end

    rect rgb(240, 255, 240)
        Note over B, Res: 4. Response & Caching Phase
        Res->>Res: Save IP to cache (respect TTL)
        Res-->>OS: Return IP address
        OS->>OS: Save IP to cache
        OS-->>B: Return IP address
        B->>B: Save IP to cache
    end

    B->>U: Connects to IP & renders page
```
