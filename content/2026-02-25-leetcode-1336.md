# Problem

You are given an integer array `arr`. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`'s y have to sort them in ascending order.<br>
**Return the array after sorting it.**

```text
Input: arr =[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Explanation : [0] is the only integer with 0 bits
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

# Solution
```java
class SortBy1Bits implements Comparator<Integer>{
    public int compare(Integer a, Integer b){
        int aBitsCount = Integer.bitCount(a);
        int bBitsCount = Integer.bitCount(b);
        
        if(aBitsCount!=bBitsCount){
            return  Integer.compare(aBitsCount,bBitsCount);
        }else{
            return Integer.compare(a,b);
        }
    }
}
class Solution{
    public int[] sortByBits(int[] arr){
        Integer[] boxed = new Integer[arr.length];
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++) boxed[i]=arr[i];
        Comparator my = new SortBy1Bits();
        Arrays.sort(boxed,my);
        
        for(int i=0;i<boxed.length;i++) arr[i]=boxed[i];
        return arr;
    }
}
```
