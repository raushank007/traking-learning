# General Approach for Each Question

1. Read the problem, rephrase it.
2. Identify the data structure (Array, String, Tree, Graph).
3. Detect the pattern.
4. Think brute force first.
5. Optimize using the relevant pattern.
6. Walk through small examples manually.
7. List edge cases.
8. Write clean code.
9. Dry run the code with multiple examples.
10. Explain time and space complexity.
